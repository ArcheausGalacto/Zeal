        Uses the query_ollama function to extract tasks from user input.
        No heuristics in Python code; we rely on the model for task extraction.
        The prompt is carefully engineered to instruct the model:
        - The userâ€™s message is provided.
        - Model should identify all actionable tasks.
        - Each task is output on its own line, wrapped as *task* <task> *task*.
        - If no tasks, model outputs nothing.

        We then write each extracted task line to tasks.txt.
        """
        prompt = f"""
You are a helpful assistant whose job is to read a user message and extract actionable tasks or instructions from it.

The user says: "{text}"

Your response:
- Identify all actionable tasks described or implied by the user's message.
- There is another bot, rules bot, which determines if the input is a rule. If it is considered a rule, ignore it. Rules are anything which are not actionable steps to accomplish a coding task.
- There is another bot which determines if the user is requesting that you begin the process. Do not add commands to begin to the task list, ignore them.
- For each task, output exactly one line, enclosed in *task* markers like this: *task* do something *task*.
- Remember that the task must have *task* before and after it. Like this, *task* do something *task*.
- Do not add any extra text or explanation.
- If no tasks can be identified, produce no output at all.
